## Title
Honda Parts Center

## Subtext
A light-weight and simpler tool for the casual music collector to keep track of their collection.

## Built using

MEN stack

# Front-end 
- Single-page application
- Mustache for rendering content
- Anime.js for cool animations

# Back-end
- Mongo, Express, Node
- MongoDB for storing user data and auth
- Express for making API requests

## Intro
For my first single page application, I aimed to build an auto parts site clone following the tutorials set out by my tutor.  This project marked a first for many different web dev practices, including ES6 modules, page routing and building my own API.

## HPC Overview
Honda Parts Center is designed to mimic the typical layout and functionality of many popular eCommerce platforms.  We were tasked with building a full-stack application that utilised an SPA front-end and a Mongo, Express, Node.js backend, with any subject matter of our choosing.


## Design
HPC's original design was pretty barebones.  I focused my time on perfecting the operation of the site and left little time for visual styling and aesthetics.  Upon returning to the project months later to polish it up, my laziness with my class management had come back to haunt me.  What should have been a simple task of adjusting icons, typefaces and colour palettes ended up taking far too many afternoons.  It is safe to say that my SASS organisational skills are top notch nowadays.

With regard to design, I chose to work with a dark colour palette of greys and reds.  This fit with the whole 'Honda' thing, as many performance Honda engines are made distinct by their bright red valve cover.  I wanted to avoid clutter, but also utlise as much of the screen real estate as possible.

## Data acquisition
The brief for this project was to create and store data ourselves (meaning no third-party API).  Instead, we were tasked to create our own REST-ful API using Express, with data stored in a MongoDB.  API endpoints were created for typical CRUD operations and functionality was tested using Postman, a free piece of API testing software. Endpoints were set up as follows (INSERT TABLE OF ENDPOINTS HERE).

## The user cart
The user's shopping cart is stored as an array of item IDs - a simple and easy solution for the time being.  Obviously when making a serious eCommerce site, it would be beneficial to keep the user's cart linked to the profile (in case they want to check out later).




## Conclusion and future plans
This project opened my eyes to the seemingly limitless possibilities with regard to web development.  Creating a single page application from scratch was daunting enough - let alone creating a REST API to work alongside it.  This was by far the biggest leap I had taken in web design and got me excited to see what the future will hold.

I will continue to revisit this site and use it as a sort of 'testing ground' for new features I would like to wrap my head around before taking them to bigger and better projects.
